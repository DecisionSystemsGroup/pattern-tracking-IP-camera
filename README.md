### Pattern Tracking IP-camera is a project created by Mybareq Hoxha, currently a student at Tecnological Educational Institute of central Greece.

This project is about an IP-camera that tracks a pattern, written in python.  
A Shixin IP-109HW is used for this example.  
The purpose of this project is educational and any correction of the code is accepted. 

#### Explaining the code

The packages that have been used are, `urllib` to take a snapshot from the camera, `numpy` to make the image into an array, `opencv` to detect the pattern and `httplib` to send commands to the IP-camera. There are comments in the code so you can undestand exactly how it works.
